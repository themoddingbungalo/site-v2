## Preamble

Ghoulified Reality is a hardcore (optionally) perma-death focused modlist for The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition that focuses on completely overhauling the game’s visuals and gameplay to create a more challenging and immersive experience. A fork of NGVO which is a visual only modlist, Ghoulified use Requiem to enhance the game for a more challenging and strategic experience, from combat to character progression. What separates this list from other Requiem lists is Ghoulified uses 3BFTweaks and other addons which makes the world more dangerous while still maintaining a sense of fairness and balance.

## System Requirements

### Disclaimer

Owing to the need to clean master files and certain errors with Wabbajack, Ghoulified Reality only supports **English Steam** versions of Skyrim Special Edition. **GOG and other Languages are not supported**.

{: .warning}
**Ghoulified Reality REQUIRES YOUR SKYRIM VERSION TO BE UPDATED TO 1.6.1170 AND REQUIRES THE AE DLC**

***

Only, Windows 10 and 11 work with Wabbajack fully. LTSC, special variants, lightened editions or any other modified variant **WILL NOT WORK**. Your windows version **must be 21H2 or newer** to run both Wabbajack and Ghoulified Reality.

Running the list from Hard Disk Drives or external drives is **STRONGLY ADVISED AGAINST**. A lot of content is swapped at game run time and, as a result, fast storage and RAM are needed.

### Recommended System Requirements

Ghoulified Reality requires a mid-tier modern system to run to its fullest potential. The recommended specs given below are based on utilizing the ENB in the list. For community shaders, you can subtract a little bit from them. Users have reported being able to run on hardware slightly lower than this, however your mileage may vary.

| Component    | Recommended for 1080p | 
|:--------------:|:-------------:|
| CPU | 10th Generation i5 or better/equivalent
| Ram | 16GB DDR4 Ram  + 40GB Pagefile 
| Storage | SATA SSD or higher
| GPU | RTX 3070 or better/equivalent

| Component    | Recommended for 1440p | 
|:--------------:|:-------------:|
| CPU | 12th Generation i7 or better/equivalent
| Ram | 32GB DDR4 Ram  + 40GB Pagefile 
| Storage | M.2 SSD
| GPU | RTX 4070 or better/equivalent

**Space required:** Around 300GB Total

See how to setup a page file [here](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/how-to-manage-virtual-memory-pagefile-windows-10,36929.html)

{: .important}
**NOTE**: AMD RX 580 and older cards are **not supported**. 

## Installation

Installing Ghoulified Reality is relatively easy and, if you have Nexus Premium, will be a simple waiting game. If you are updating the modlist, you can safely skip to the [updating section](#updating).

### Pre-Installation

Prior to installing Ghoulified Reality, please complete the following steps.

1. Install [Visual C++ x64](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe) & [.Net Runtime v5 desktop x64](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/thank-you/runtime-8.0.5-windows-x64-installer)
2. Change Skyrim so it does not [automatically update](https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/71AB-698D-57EB-178C#disable).
3. Fully uninstall Skyrim by deleting the folder and the Skyrim Special edition folder inside \Documents\My Games\.
4. Fully disable OneDrive and any other programs which hook into user file areas.
5. Reinstall Skyrim into a location that is not Program files. Somewhere like `C:\Games` is a good location. If you only have one drive, look into LostDragonist's [SteamLibrary tool](https://github.com/LostDragonist/steam-library-setup-tool/wiki/Usage-Guide).
6. Start the game once and let it do the graphics check. Do not worry about the settings as it will be replaced during installation.
7. Launch the game to the main menu and allow it to download the free creation club addon files. **DO NOT VERIFY YOUR GAME FILES**
8. Open your Skyrim folder (`SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Skyrim Special Edition\Data`) and delete `ccbgssse037-curios.bsa` & `ccbgssse037-curios.esp`.
9. Relaunch Skyrim, go into the Creation Club, and redownload Rare Curios. Go back to the main menu and close the game.
10. Download the [Skyrim SE Creation Kit](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1946180/Skyrim_Special_Edition_Creation_Kit/) from Steam and run it once.
11. Remove/Disable any 3rd party antivirus such as MalwareBytes or Webroot. These **will** mess with the installation and, in the case of the latter, causes more problems than it solves.

### Wabbajack Installation

#### Installing Wabbajack

Once you have completed pre-installation, download the [latest version of Wabbajack](https://github.com/wabbajack-tools/wabbajack/releases) and place it in a folder such as `C:\Games\Wabbajack`. Do not place it in program files, on your desktop or in your downloads folder. I recommend placing it on an SSD as it will work quicker on there.

{: .important}
**NOTE**: Ghoulified Reality will **always** require the latest version of Wabbajack **UNLESS IT IS SPECIFICALLY STATED HERE**. 

#### Downloading and Installing Ghoulified Reality

Downloading and installing Ghoulified Reality can take a while depending on your internet connection and computer. To install Ghoulified Reality, complete the following steps.

1. Open Wabbajack and click on browse modlists.
2. Press the download button on Ghoulified Reality and wait for it to download.
3. Set the installation folder to be somewhere like C:\Ghoulified Reality. **Do not install it to your desktop or downloads folder.**
4. The download location does not need to be on a SSD but it makes installing a bit faster.
5. Press the play button to begin.
6. Go and pet your nearest fluffy animal whilst Wabbajack does its thing. Alternatively read through this readme again.
7. If the installation is successful, jump for joy and move onto [post installation](#post-installation). If the installation is unsuccessful, follow what is below.

##### Problems with installation

It is possible that you may encounter an error with Wabbajack when installing. Some common issues are listed below.

- Could not download x:
  - Big files can fail to download due to connection issues. You can either run Wabbajack again or download the file manually. If you decide to manually download it, make sure to place it in the same place as the other downloads.

- x is not a whitelisted download:

   - This will happen when I update the modlist. Please check if there is a new update or wait until you see a release ping.

- Wabbajack could not find my game folder:

  - Either buy the game or go back to the [Pre-Installation](#pre-installation) step.

- Antivirus reports a virus:
  - You did not follow the steps in [Pre-Installation](#pre-installation). Go back and follow it.
  - If you have followed it then you can fix this by [adding an exclusion for Mod Organizer in Windows Defender](https://www.thewindowsclub.com/exclude-a-folder-from-windows-security-scan).

## Post-Installation

### Stock Game & Root Builder

Ghoulified Reality utilizes a Wabbajack technology called Stock Game. What this essentially does is create a copy of your Skyrim installation within the installation location of the list. This enables greater compatibility with other mod-lists.

Ghoulified Reality also utilizes Root Builder alongside Stock Game to enable easier management of hooks such as ENB, Reshade and Engine Fixes. Please see our guide to [Root Builder](https://github.com/The-Animonculory/Modding-Resources/blob/main/Root%20Builder%20for%20Skyrim%20AE.md) for more details.

**NOTE**: Screenshots save to `Overwrite\Stock Game`.

### Starting up the list
Open the installation folder and double-click on the program called `ModOrganizer.exe`. 

You'll get a NXM pop up once MO2 is launched just hit ignore.

Make sure the dropdown box on the right is set to `Ghoulified Reality` and press the `Run` button.

### Optional Mods
In MO2 there are two sections labeled optional one for game play and one for combat animations. All mods in those sections can be turned on or off at any time this is also where you can enable perma-death.
Mods to read up on 

- **3BFTweaks** - I recommend you check the guide section for more information. 
- **AD-Mortem perma-death** - This will automatically delete all saves upon dying if you enable it. 
- **Smart Harvest NG AutoLoot** - Can be set to auto loot anything in the game when walking near it. By default it only picks up alchemy ingredients.
- **Modex - A Mod Explorer Menu (AddItemMenu)** - This is your go to mod for testing and potentially fixing bugs in your run.
- **SKSE Menu Framework** - A menu that controls SKSE mods. You can activate it by hitting F1 in game. This is also where you can change your FOV 

### In-game MCM options

Ghoulified Reality automatically runs the mcm options for you, just stand still until you get a pop up saying it has finished.

After the mcm is done open your inventory and close it to start 3BFTweaks.
 
## Updating the modlist

Before updating, please check the changelog and back up your saves. You may need to start a new game after certain updates.

Updating is like installing the list. Simply make sure your paths are the same and tick the `overwrite existing modlist` button. **Note**: Any mods you have added will be deleted when updating.

## Removing the Modlist
Simply delete the folder, and you have uninstalled it.
